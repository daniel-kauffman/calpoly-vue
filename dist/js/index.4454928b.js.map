Since speed is one of the primary reasons to use Vim, you will more quickly reap its benefits if you force yourself to use the home row for movement.</p>\n    <div class=\"d-inline-flex flex-wrap\">\n      <CommandTable :commands=\"{'h': 'move left',\n                                'j': 'move down',\n                                'k': 'move up',\n                                'l': 'move right'}\">\n        Single-Character Movement\n      </CommandTable>\n      <CommandTable :commands=\"{'CTRL+u': 'scroll up',\n                                'CTRL+d': 'scroll down',\n                                'g+g': 'move to file top',\n                                '<NUM>+g+g': 'move to line <NUM>',\n                                'SHIFT+g': 'move to file bottom'}\">\n        Vertical Movement\n      </CommandTable>\n      <CommandTable :commands=\"{'0': 'move to line start',\n                                '$': 'move to line end', \n                                'w': 'move to next word start',\n                                'b': 'move to previous word start',\n                                'e': 'move to current word end',\n                                'f+<CHAR>': 'move to next <CHAR>',\n                                'SHIFT+f+<CHAR>': 'move to previous <CHAR>'}\">\n        Horizontal Movement\n      </CommandTable>\n    </div>\n\n    <h4>Clipboard</h4>\n    <p>The clipboard stores text that was previously cut or copied to it.

Since these split and tabbed windows exist in the same Vim session, characters can be copied from one file and pasted into another easily.

Recursion is defined by the definition of recursion. While somewhat unsatisfying, this definition illustrates the basic idea: a recursive function definition is one that calls the function it defines.</p>\n      <p>A concept this abstract is best understood with an example (test cases in <span style=\"color: green;\">green</span>):</p>\n\n      <pre>\n      def reverse(ints):<span style=\"color: red;\">\n          if len(ints) == 0:\n              return []</span>\n          <span style=\"color: blue;\">return reverse(ints[1:]) + ints[:1]</span>\n      <span style=\"color: green;\">\n      reverse([])         # returns []\n      reverse([1])        # returns [1]\n      reverse([1, 2, 3])  # returns [3, 2, 1]</span></pre>\n\n      <p>Although this function definition is only 4 lines, there is a deep and fascinating process embedded in this code. The input argument <code>ints</code> is a list of integers that are to be reversed. However, what if this list was empty? What should the function return in this case? An empty list seems most appropriate, so the first two lines of the function body (highlighted in <span style=\"color: red;\">red</span>) check for this condition; this branch is called the <strong>base case</strong>.</p>\n      <p>The final line of the function is the most dense but notice that there are no new language features. The + operator is being used for list concatenation, rather than addition. The right operand is a slice of the <code>ints</code> list which is equivalent to <code>[ints[0]]</code> (recall that slicing a list always results in a list, even if that list only has zero or one elements). The left operand is the recursive call, which is passed a list of all but the first element of the original list. This line (highlighted in <span style=\"color: blue;\">blue</span>) is the <strong>recursive case</strong>.</p>\n      <p>To further illustrate the process, the following lines go through the recursive steps, starting with the top-most function call in <span style=\"color: red;\">red</span>. Since the base case is not used until the last recursive call, it is de-emphasized in <span style=\"color: gray;\">gray</span>. It is perhaps easiest to trace the recursion from the bottom, starting with the function call in <span style=\"color: purple;\">purple</span>. In this case, the input argument is the empty list and the base condition is true, resulting in an empty list. Since the <span style=\"color: purple;\">purple</span> call returned <code>[]</code>, the <span style=\"color: blue;\">blue</span> recursive call will return <code>[] + [3]</code> which simply equals <code>[3]</code>. This process continues back to the top-most function call returning <code>[3, 2, 1]</code>.</p>\n\n      <pre><span style=\"color: red;\">\n      reverse([1, 2, 3])</span><span style=\"color: gray;\">\n          if len([1, 2, 3]) == 0:\n              return []</span>\n          return <span style=\"color: green;\">reverse([2, 3])</span> + [1]   # return [3, 2] + [1]\n      <span style=\"color: green;\">\n      reverse([2, 3])</span><span style=\"color: gray;\">\n          if len([2, 3]) == 0:\n              return []</span>\n          return <span style=\"color: blue;\">reverse([3])</span> + [2]      # return [3] + [2]\n      <span style=\"color: blue;\">\n      reverse([3])</span><span style=\"color: gray;\">\n          if len([3]) == 0:\n              return []</span>\n          return <span style=\"color: purple;\">reverse([])</span> + [3]       # return [] + [3]\n      <span style=\"color: purple;\">\n      reverse([])</span>\n          if len([]) == 0:\n              return []<span style=\"color: gray;\">\n          return reverse([]) + []</span></pre>\n\n      <p>Importantly, notice that the base case does not make a recursive call. What would happen had there been no base case? Each recursive call would continue to make a subsequent call to reverse indefinitely; this bug is referred to as <strong>infinite recursion</strong>. Like an infinite loop, infinite recursion stems from a lack of sufficient checks to halt the endless repetition of code execution. Unlike an infinite loop, however, there is a limit to the number of recursive calls a computer can make and thus the program will usually halt without requiring user intervention.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p>All functions must use recursion.

The simulation starts when the retro-rockets cut off, using a predetermined amount of fuel and altitude (with an initial velocity of zero meters per second). With the thrusters off and the LM in free-fall, lunar gravity is causing the LM to accelerate toward the surface. The agent must control the rate of descent using the thrusters of the LM by selecting a rate of fuel flow each second. A fuel rate of 0% means free-fall, 50% maintains the current velocity, and 100% means maximum thrust. To make things interesting (and to reflect reality) the LM has a limited amount of fuel. If your agent runs out of fuel before touching down, it has lost control of the LM, which then free-falls to the surface. The goal is to land the LM on the surface with a velocity greater than <code>-1</code> meters per second, using the least amount of fuel possible. Note that a negative velocity indicates movement toward the moon, while a positive velocity indicates movement away from it.</p>\n      <p>While this simulation is inspired from the moon landing, you may simulate landing on other celestial bodies as well. One of the simulator initialization values is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force\">g-force</a> applied to the module. The following table provides the g-force at (or near) the surface of various objects.</p>\n      <table>\n        <tr><th>Object</th><th>G-force</th></tr>\n        <tr><td>Pluto</td><td>0.063</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Moon</td><td>0.1657</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Mars</td><td>0.378</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Venus</td><td>0.905</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Earth</td><td>1.0</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Jupiter</td><td>2.528</td></tr>\n      </table><br/>\n\n      <h4>Q-Learning</h4>\n      <p>Reinforcement learning is an iterative process using a system of rewards to develop a policy that dictates what action to apply in any given state. That is, it approximates a function <code>&pi;(S) -&gt; A</code> that maps states to (ideally optimal) actions to apply in those states. Each state in the environment has a (usually unknown) utility value that is approximated throughout the learning process, so that ultimately actions can be chosen that lead to states with higher utilities. The utility of a state is based on predefined rewards received in that state and the potential rewards of successor states.</p>\n      <p>As with problems discussed previously, learning environments use a transition model <code>T(S, A) -&gt; S'</code> that maps a state-action pair to a successor state. However, many environments exist in which this model is not known prior to the learning process. A well-established approach to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-free_(reinforcement_learning)\">model-free</a> reinforcement learning is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning\">Q-learning</a>, which observes transitions from exploring the environment to approximate a function <code>Q(S, A) -&gt; U</code> that maps state-action pairs to the estimated utility of that successor state. With this Q-function, the policy function &pi; would be equivalent to <code>&pi;(S) = argmax<sub>A</sub> Q(S, A)</code>, which means return the action <code>A</code> that results in the highest utility returned from <code>Q(S, A)</code>.</p>\n      <p>While a more precise approximation of the Q-function would use a sophisticated model like a neural network, for small environments a Q-table (matrix) indexed by state (row-wise) and action (column-wise) to a utility entry can be sufficient and is much faster to train and easier to implement.</p>\n      <p>During the training phase, table updates are performed using the following formula,</p>\n      <pre>\n(1 - &alpha;) * Q(s, a) + &alpha;(R(s) + &gamma; * max<sub>a'</sub>{Q(s', a')})</pre>\n      <p>where <code>&alpha;</code> is the learning rate and <code>&gamma;</code> is the discount factor, both determined using experimentation (<code>&alpha;</code> often starts high and decreases throughout the learning process). <code>R</code> is the reward function, which is specific to the problem. Note that since every call to the <code>Q</code> function is simply a table look up, this formula demonstrates <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization\">memoization</a> rather than recursion.</p>\n\n      <h4>Reward Function</h4>\n      <p>Every reinforcement learning process involves a reward function, which specifies the immediate value of being in a particular state. These functions may be very simple or contain a complex sequence of conditions, depending on the environment. In the context of the LM, a reward function would need, at a minimum, to detect when a terminal state is reached (i.e. when the altitude is zero) and provide a value based on the LM's velocity so that softer landings are more highly rewarded. In addition, the LM should be encouraged to move toward a terminal state (mainly so it does not try to hover in place until fuel runs out), which can be done in various ways that may include using the altitude, fuel, as well as imposing a small penalty for being in a non-terminal state. Devising an appropriate reward function is one of the many challenges of implementing a reinforcement learning-based agent.</p>\n\n      <h4>&epsilon;-Greedy Selection</h4>\n      <p>During the training phase of reinforcement learning, actions must be selected to produce successor states. It would seem natural to select actions greedily by choosing the action in a given state that, according to the Q-function, results in the successor state with the highest utility. This greedy approach is <strong>exploitive</strong> of the knowledge built thus far, but since the utilities during training are still changing, it is possible that higher-utility action sequences exist. A simple way to encourage <strong>exploration</strong> is to allow a small &epsilon; chance of choosing an action at random instead of the current best one. This chance may start higher at the beginning of training and gradually decrease over time, which has the effect of encouraging a lot of exploration early on and reinforcing known strong action sequences near the end.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p><strong>Allowed Modules:</strong> random</p>\n      <p>The provided starter file contains the <code>ModuleState</code> class to represent states in the simulation. These objects are initialized with a starting fuel, altitude, velocity (which is always zero for the first state), the g-force applied to the module, and a transition function. Successor <code>ModuleState</code> objects are generated by calling the <code>use_fuel</code> method, which takes a fuel rate as its argument and uses the transition function to calculate the module's acceleration, which in turn impacts the altitude and velocity of the successor state. The transition function can be any callable that accepts two floats: the acceleration due to gravity (in m/s<sup>2</sup>) and the fuel rate selected. While a reasonable transition function is provided in the file, you may use any (unrealistic) function with this signature for your tests (e.g. a function that just returns a constant value).</p>\n      <p>At each state, the module can use one of its available fuel rates to move to a successor state by passing the rate to <code>use_fuel</code>. For example, a module with <code>5</code> available rates would have the following action set and corresponding amounts of thrust.</p>\n      <table>\n        <tr><th>Action</th><th>Fuel Rate</th></tr>\n        <tr><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>1</td><td>25%</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>2</td><td>50%</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>3</td><td>75%</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>4</td><td>100%</td></tr>\n      </table>\n      <br/>\n      <p>Note that larger action sets offer more control (higher sensitivity to differences in rate changes), but require larger Q-tables and thus more training time.</p>\n\n      <FunctionSignature name=\"learn_q\" :params=\"[['state', 'ModuleState']]\" type=\"Callable[[ModuleState, int], float]\"/>\n      <p>Return a Q-function that maps a state-action pair to a utility value. This function must be a callable with the signature shown. When this Q-function is used by an agent to make a policy, the lander must always reach its target surface with an impact velocity greater than <code>-1</code>. Assume that the g-force and transition function provided to the given <code>ModuleState</code> object will be the same one used to test the Q-function generated (but make no such assumption about the other initial values). For both the training and testing phases, assume that the starting altitude is never above <code>100</code> meters.</p>\n      <p>The function returned may be a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)\">closure</a> as in the following example:</p>\n      <pre>q = lambda s, a: table.get((s, a))</pre>\n      <p>This example assumes a variable named <code>table</code> exists and its value has a <code>get</code> method. Your implementation may be different so long as it returns a function object with the signature <code>(ModuleState, int) -&gt; float</code>. For simplicity, it is recommended that this function use a table lookup (i.e. a dictionary) to map state-action pairs to utilities. Care must be taken to appropriately discretize the state representations (which may include the module's current fuel, altitude, and velocity) so that the table does not become too large.</p>\n\n      <p>The action set may be changed from the default of <code>(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)</code> by calling the <code>set_actions</code> method of the <code>ModuleState</code> class.

Searching for puzzles of maximum difficulty - that is, puzzles with the longest optimal path for their size - represents a very different challenge.</p>\n      <p>One strategy would be to start from a solved puzzle and move toward puzzle states with longer optimal paths; another would be to start from randomly generated puzzles, which would first need to be verified to be solvable. In either case, the length of the optimal path for any state in the search can often only be known by solving that puzzle, which is an expensive operation. To expedite the search, only select states should be solved, guiding the search through unsolved states using heuristics.</p>\n      <h4>Puzzle Solvability</h4>\n      <p>Some local search algorithms rely on creating many random states to cover more of the state space. Therefore, when searching for complex shuffled states, it becomes necessary to verify that a state generated randomly is solvable before using it as a starting point to search for more complex states.</p>\n      <p>Any move made from a solvable puzzle state is guaranteed to be solvable; conversely, any move made from an unsolvable puzzle state is likewise unsolvable. If the solved puzzle state is used to search for shuffled puzzle states, any resulting state will always be solvable.</p>\n      <p>The solvability of a puzzle state can be determined by counting the number of inversions in a one-dimensional list of integers representing the tiles.

When taking all clues into account, only Assignment #3 is possible.</p>\n      <div class=\"flex-container board-set\">\n        <table class=\"board\">\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>&#x1f4a5;</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>&#x1f4a5;</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>Assignment #1</th>\n        </table>\n        <table class=\"board\">\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>&#x1f4a5;</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>&#x1f4a5;</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>Assignment #2</th>\n        </table>\n        <table class=\"board\">\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>&#x1f4a5;</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>&#x1f4a5;</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>Assignment #3</th>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>Thus, to set up the CSP, all possible mine placements with respect to each clue should be generated, which serve as that clue's domain. These domains will then be reduced during the propagation step (see below) to determine which spaces are safe.</p>\n\n      <h4>Constraint Propagation</h4>\n      <p>In a CSP, a pair of variables that share a binary constraint (that is, some limitation placed on both variables together), is known as an <strong>arc</strong>. If all binary constraints are satisfied in a state (an assignment of variables), that state is said to be <strong>arc consistent</strong>. It is possible to represent any CSP in terms of only binary constraints, and doing so can make writing the propagation algorithm easier. (The conversion to binary constraints can sometimes be cumbersome, as in the case of the 9x9 puzzle Sudoku, in which the cells in every row, for example, have 9-ary constraints.)</p>\n      <p>For this problem, any two clues that share at least one unexplored space form an arc. Diagram A has the following arcs, where each number refers to the index of a clue.</p>\n      <pre>(1, 4) (4, 1) (1, 7) (7, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (4, 10) (10, 4) (7, 10) (10, 7)</pre>\n      <p>Notice that the ordering of each arc matters - <code>(1, 4)</code> is distinct from <code>(4, 1)</code> - which will be important for the propagation algorithm.</p>\n      <p>By establishing the arcs between variables, their domains may be reduced (known as constraint propagation) by determing which values in each of the pair's domain conflict with one another. For example, in arc <code>(4, 1)</code>, since the clue at index 1 allows for only one adjacent mine, Assignment #1 above (taken from the domain of the clue at index 4) is not possible.</p>\n\n      <p>Constraint propagation may be performed over a set of arcs using the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-3_algorithm\">AC-3 algorithm</a>. This process uses a set that contains every arc in the state space. As each arc is removed from the set, the domain of one variable (say, the left-sided one in the arc) is made arc consistent with the other variable by eliminating any values in the left-sided variable's domain that are impossible in the other. If no values are removed from the variable's domain, the algorithm moves on to the next arc; otherwise, all arcs containing the left-sided variable <strong>on the right side</strong> are added to the set. For example, since making <code>(4, 1)</code> arc consistent resulted in a domain reduction, then <code>(7, 4)</code> would need to be re-added. This step is necessary since reductions to the variable's domains might allow reductions of other variable's domains with which it shares a binary constraint, which would only be found if these arcs were brought back into the set. The algorithm continues until the set is empty, at which point all variables have been made arc consistent. However, if at any point a variable's domain is reduced to nothing, then there exists no solution from the state at which constraint propagation was run.</p>\n       <p>Unlike some CSPs, in Minesweeper, trial and error is not an option, as uncovering a mine ends the game (an example of an environment that is <strong>not safely explorable</strong>). Thus, all boards used for this assignment will be solvable using inference via constraint propagation without any guessing.</p>\n\n      <h4>Exploring Safely</h4>\n      <p>A Minesweeper solver must alternate between domain reduction (via AC-3) and inferring which spaces are safe in these reduced domains. Again using Diagram A above, the clues adjacent to an unexplored space have the following domains. In this notation, each integer represents a board index, with a positive integer representing a mine at that index and a negative integer representing that index as safe. Integers within parentheses represent one possible assignment in the domain.</p>\n      <p>When comparing two domains for a contradiction, only compare the indices they have in common. For example, when comparing the domains of Clues 1 and 4, ignore the <code>8</code>. Doing so shows that <code>(2, 5, -8)</code> is not possible because <code>(2, 5)</code> is not in Clue 1's domain.</p>\n      <table>\n        <tr><th>Clue Index</th><th>Clue Value<br />(Mine Count)</th><th>Domain</th></tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>1</td>\n          <td>1</td>\n          <td><code>(2, -5)</code> <code>(-2, 5)</code></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>4</td>\n          <td>2</td>\n          <td><code>(2, 5, -8)</code> <code>(2, -5, 8)</code> <code>(-2, 5, 8)</code></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>7</td>\n          <td>2</td>\n          <td><code>(5, 8, -11)</code> <code>(5, -8, 11)</code> <code>(-5, 8, 11)</code></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>10</td>\n          <td>1</td>\n          <td><code>(8, -11)</code> <code>(-8, 11)</code></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n      <br />\n\n      <p>To start a domain reduction simulation, let's remove <code>(2, 5, -8)</code> since <code>2</code> and <code>5</code> cannot both contain a mine; <code>(-5, 8, 11)</code> can be removed for a similar reason.

Recall that a variable's domain represents all possible assignments to that variable. Thus, if there exists an index in any domain that is always safe (i.e. every possible assignment in a domain has no mine at an index), that index must be safe. In this example, both indices <code>2</code> and <code>11</code> are always mine-free in at least one domain; thus, both of these spaces are safely explorable and either may be selected for the next move.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p><b>Allowed Modules:</b> <code>itertools</code> (for combinations and permutations)</p>\n\n      <p>For this assignment, Minesweeper boards will be represented as 2D lists of integers, in which each inner list represents one row of the board; within each row, a non-negative integer indicates the number of mines adjacent to the space at that position and <code>-1</code> represents a mine.

The initial state is shown below.</p>\n      <pre>\n((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),\n (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),\n (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),\n (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))</pre>\n      <p>In addition, some spaces may be set to <code>None</code> before the game begins. These spaces should be considered barriers that no player may select for a move. This feature allows for the reduction of the search space, which can simplify the creation of tests.</p>\n      <p>See the starter file for the <code>GameState</code> class, which provides a representation of game states, including the current player, the actions available at that state, and the utility of the state, as well as a means to traverse the game tree.</p>\n\n      <FunctionSignature name=\"find_best_move\" :params=\"[['state', 'GameState']]\"/>\n      <p>Search the game tree for the optimal move for the current player, storing the index of the move in the given GameState object's <code>selected</code> attribute. The move must be an integer indicating an index in the 3D board - ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>63</code> - with <code>0</code> as the index of the top-left space of the top board and <code>63</code> as the index of the bottom-right space of the bottom board.</p>\n      <p>This function must perform a Monte Carlo Tree Search to select a move, calling additional functions as necessary. During the search, whenever a better move is found, the <code>selected</code> attribute should be immediately updated for retrieval by the instructor's game driver. Be sure to update <code>selected</code> with the move that has the highest <strong>win ratio</strong>, not highest UCB.</p>\n      <p>Each call to this function will be given a set number of seconds to run; when the time limit is reached, the index stored in <code>selected</code> will be used. Note that this function will only be evaluated on finding the best move for isolated boards; in other words, it will <strong>not</strong> be run multiple times in succession on the same board until a player wins.</p>\n\n      <h4>Extra Credit Tournament</h4>\n      <p>You may earn extra credit through a class 3D Tic-Tac-Toe tournament that will be conducted in a round-robin format (each agent plays against every other agent), with the top students receiving an amount based on their ranking (ties will grant each such student the highest number of points for that block). An empty table will be passed in for the player as a dictionary on the first turn to memoize the win ratio statistics that it finds at each game state and its contents will be maintained and provided for each subsequent call of <code>find_best_move</code> for that player throughout a game.</p>\n      <p>Every functioning program will be automatically entered into the tournament. There will be no <code>None</code> barrier spaces in the tournament.</p>\n    </template>\n  </Assignment>\n</template>\n\n\n<script>\nimport Assignment from \"@/components/BaseAssignment.vue\"\nimport FunctionSignature from \"@/components/AssignmentFunctionSignature.vue\"\n\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    Assignment,\n    FunctionSignature\n  },\n  data:\n    function () {\n      return {\n        name: \"boardstupid\",\n        title: \"Project V: Board Stupid\",\n        files: [\"boardstupid.py\"],\n        rubric: {\n          \"Finds Optimal Move Among 8 Spaces\": 20,\n          \"Finds Optimal Move Among 14 Spaces\": 30,\n          \"Finds Optimal Move Among 22 Spaces\": 50\n        }\n      };\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n<style scoped>\ntr:first-child {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ProjectBoardStupid.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ProjectBoardStupid.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./ProjectBoardStupid.vue?vue&type=template&id=6fbeb27d&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./ProjectBoardStupid.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./ProjectBoardStupid.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./ProjectBoardStupid.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=6fbeb27d&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"6fbeb27d\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('Assignment',{attrs:{\"name\":_vm.name,\"title\":_vm.title,\"files\":_vm.files,\"rubric\":_vm.rubric},scopedSlots:_vm._u([{key:\"description\",fn:function(){return [_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Sliding Tile Puzzles (or N-Puzzles) are single-user games that require one to move tiles around a grid until the tiles are in a particular order.

We will represent such a sequence of moves as a string, where each character in the string is a single move.</p>\n\n      <p>To represent tile movement, we will use the same navigation keys as in Vim, specifically:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><code>\"H\"</code>: Left</li>\n        <li><code>\"J\"</code>: Down</li>\n        <li><code>\"K\"</code>: Up</li>\n        <li><code>\"L\"</code>: Right</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>In the following sequence of diagrams, a 2x2 puzzle is solved with the path of moves that is generated under each state.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"flex-container tile-container\">\n        <table class=\"tiles\">\n          <tr><td></td><td>2</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=2>\"\"</th>\n        </table>\n        <table class=\"tiles\">\n          <tr><td>2</td><td></td></tr>\n          <tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=2>\"H\"</th>\n        </table>\n        <table class=\"tiles\">\n          <tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>3</td><td></td></tr>\n          <th colspan=2>\"HK\"</th>\n        </table>\n        <table class=\"tiles\">\n          <tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <tr><td></td><td>3</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=2>\"HKL\"</th>\n        </table>\n        <table class=\"tiles\">\n          <tr><td></td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=2>\"HKLJ\"</th>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>The path \"HKLJ\" is an optimal (shortest possible) path from the initial state to the final state. There are, of course, infinite non-optimal paths, such as \"HLHLHLHLHLHKLJ\" where the first move is repeatedly undone by going backward. Note that finding the optimal path using brute force is impractical; if the optimal path for a 4x4 puzzle is 20 moves long and there are an average of two valid, non-opposing moves that can be made on each turn, that would require up to 2<sup>20</sup> (over one million) paths to check!</p>\n\n      <p>Thus, to efficiently find an optimal path, you will implement the A* algorithm, a famous search technique in the field of artificial intelligence. The algorithm works by evaluating the cost of each path using the following sum:</p>\n\n      <p>Path Cost = Length of Current Path + Estimated Distance to Final State</p>\n\n      <p>For example, the cost of the path \"HKL\" in the fourth diagram above is the sum of its length, 3, and the Manhattan distance to the final state, 1, for a path cost of 4.</p>\n\n      <p>The algorithm begins by finding all frontier puzzle states available from the initial state. On each iteration of a loop, the frontier state with the lowest cost is explored, which requires generating all possible new puzzle states from it. Once these new states are created, the state that created them is removed from the list of frontier states. This process of exploring lowest-cost states and generating new states continues until the lowest-cost state has a distance of zero, indicating that it is the final state and an optimal path was found.</p>\n\n      <h4>Search Heuristics</h4>\n      <p>In order for A* Search to be optimal, all heuristics used must be admissible and consistent when combined. Thus, it is important that the heuristics do not count any of the same moves when computing their estimated distances.</p>\n      <p><strong>Note that the following heuristics methods are already implemented for you in the starter file.</strong> The descriptions below serve as an example of the potential complexities in computing the heuristic for an informed search.</p>\n\n      <h6>Manhattan Distance</h6>\n      <p>Unlike Euclidean distance, which measures the distance between two points as a straight line, Manhattan distance does so by counting the number of tiles that must be traversed between two tiles in a grid. This approach is similar to how one thinks about distance when driving in a grid-like city or moving between squares on a game board. Importantly, when calculating Manhattan distance you cannot traverse diagonally.</p>\n      <div class=\"flex-container tile-container\">\n        <table>\n          <tr>\n            <td style=\"background-color: lime\"></td>\n            <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>\n            <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td></td><td></td><td></td>\n            <td style=\"background-color: blue\"></td>\n            <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>\n            <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>\n            <td style=\"background-color: red\"></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n      <br />\n      <p>In the grid above, the green and blue squares have a distance of 4, the blue and red squares have a distance of 6, and the green and red squares have a distance of 10.</p>\n      <p>Manhattan distance can be used to determine how far a particular state of a puzzle is from its final solved state. To do so, sum up the Manhattan distance of each tile (not including the blank tile) from its current position to its final position.</p>\n      <div class=\"flex-container tile-container\">\n        <table class=\"tiles\">\n          <tr><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>4</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>5</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>Random Puzzle State</th>\n        </table>\n        <table class=\"tiles\">\n          <tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>Final Puzzle State</th>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n      <p>In the example above, the Manhattan distance is 8 (verify this result yourself).</p>\n\n      <h6>Linear Conflicts</h6>\n      <p>The Manhattan distance used as a heuristic for solving sliding tile puzzles can be augmented by observing when two or more tiles are in linear conflict. For two tiles to be in linear conflict, they must be in their correct row or column but be in incorrect order. Since one tile will need to move out of the row or column (to get out of the other tile's way) and then move back again, each linear conflict adds 2 to the total estimated distance.</p>\n      <div class=\"flex-container tile-container\">\n        <table>\n          <tr><td>*</td><td>7</td><td>*</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>*</td><td>4</td><td>*</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>*</td><td>1</td><td>*</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>1, 4, and 7 are<br>in linear conflict</th>\n        </table>\n        <table>\n          <tr><td>7</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>*</td><td>4</td><td>*</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>1 and 7 can exit goal<br>column to go around 4</th>\n        </table>\n        <table>\n          <tr><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>1</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>*</td><td>4</td><td>*</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>7</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr>\n          <th colspan=3>1 and 7 must eventually<br>re-enter goal column</th>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n      <p>A conflicting tile only needs to move out of the way of other tiles once. Furthermore, only the <b>minimum</b> number of tiles that must move in a row or column should be counted as conflicts to ensure that conflicts are not overcounted. This heuristic may be calculated as follows:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Find the tiles that are in conflict for each row or column.</li>\n        <li>For each row or column with conflicts:</li>\n        <ol type=\"a\">\n          <li>Find the tile that has the highest number of conflicts relative to the other tiles. Remove this tile from consideration and increment the number of conflicts found.</li>\n          <li>Repeat the step above until the remaining tiles under consideration have no conflicts with one another.</li>\n        </ol>\n      </ol>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p><b>Allowed Modules:</b> queue</p>\n      <p>Tiles will be represented as a tuple of integers, with each integer a single tile in the puzzle in row-major order. The blank tile will be represented with the integer 0.</p>\n\n      <p>For example, the left-most puzzle in the first diagram above would be represented as:</p>\n      <pre>(3, 7, 1, 4, 0, 2, 6, 8, 5)</pre>\n      <p>Tiles may only be moved in a given direction if the blank tile is there. For example, a tile may only be moved up if the blank tile is above it.</p>\n\n      <p>Use the <code>get</code> static method in the provided <code>Heuristic</code> class to compute the combined Manhattan distance and linear conflicts heuristic for a given set of tiles.</p>\n      <pre>\nHeuristic.get((0, 1, 2, 3)) -&gt; 0\nHeuristic.get((3, 2, 1, 0)) -&gt; 6</pre>\n\n      <h4>Required Functions</h4>\n      <p>You only need to implement the function(s) below, which will serve as the interface for the submission system's test driver. However, your program should demonstrate good decomposition with additional functions or classes.</p>\n\n      <AssignmentFunctionSignature name=\"solve_puzzle\" :params=\"[['tiles', 'Tuple[int, ...]']]\" type=\"str\" />\n      <p>Find a path containing the optimal number of moves to the solution and return it as a string. A state is considered a solution if its Manhattan distance to an ordered tuple of integers equals zero.</p>\n      <p>Any state added to the frontier should represent a move that is both <b>valid</b> (a tile can move in that direction) and <b>non-opposing</b> (does not undo the previous move). There is at least one and at most three valid, non-opposing moves that can be made from an arbitrary state (except the first move, which may have up to four).</p>\n      <p>Your puzzle states representations (whether they be objects, dictionaries, etc.) should, in addition to the tiles, contain at least the path string used to get to the state and its estimated distance to the goal. For efficiency, the heuristic should only be computed once per state. To be under the time limit, you may need to use a priority queue (see <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html?highlight=queue%20priorityqueue#queue.PriorityQueue\">queue.PriorityQueue</a>) for the frontier states; if inserting objects into the queue, you will need to implement a <code><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__\">__lt__</a></code> method for its class so that the objects may be compared for prioritiy.</p>\n\n      <h4>Sample Puzzles</h4>\n      <p>The following 3x3 puzzles have an optimal solution of 30 moves and may be useful for testing.</p>\n      <pre>\n(0, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 1, 8)\n(6, 7, 8, 3, 0, 5, 1, 2, 4)\n(8, 2, 0, 5, 4, 3, 7, 1, 6)</pre>\n    </template>\n  </Assignment>\n</template>\n\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data:\n    function () {\n      return {\n        name: \"tiledriver1\",\n        title: \"Project I: Tile Driver\",\n        files: [\"tiledriver.py\"],\n        rubric: {\n          \"Solve Any 2x2 Puzzle\": 5,\n          \"Optimally Solve Any 2x2 Puzzle\": 20,\n          \"Solve 20-Length 3x3 Puzzles\": 10,\n          \"Optimally Solve 20-Length 3x3 Puzzles\": 20,\n          \"Solve 30-Length 3x3 Puzzles\": 15,\n          \"Optimally Solve 30-Length 3x3 Puzzles\": 30\n        }\n      };\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n<style scoped>\n.flex-container.tile-container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\ntable {\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  margin-left: 1em;\n  margin-right: 1em;\n}\ntd {\n  border: 1px solid gray;\n  height: 4em;\n  width: 4em;\n  text-align: center;\n}\ntable.tiles td:empty {\n  background-color: gray;\n}\nth {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ProjectTileDriver1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ProjectTileDriver1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./ProjectTileDriver1.vue?vue&type=template&id=3699c6ed&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./ProjectTileDriver1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./ProjectTileDriver1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./ProjectTileDriver1.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=3699c6ed&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"3699c6ed\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('Assignment',{attrs:{\"name\":_vm.name,\"title\":_vm.title,\"files\":_vm.files},scopedSlots:_vm._u([{key:\"description\",fn:function(){return [_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Hashing is the process of storing values in a \"),_c('em',[_vm._v(\"hash table\")]),_vm._v(\", usually represented as a list or array.

Table positions (also called \"slots\" or \"buckets\") are generated using a <em>hash function</em>, which is usually composed of simple arithmetic operations to keep table access fast.</p>\n    <p>In order to allow for duplicate values in the table, each value must have a unique key associated with it; it is these keys, rather than their values, that are passed to the hash function to determine where the value should be stored in the table. However, even with unique keys, hash collisions - in which the hash function outputs the same position for different keys - are possible, and any hash table must employ some kind of collision resolution method.</p>\n    <p>Two of the most common collision resolution methods are as follows.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Separate Chaining:</strong> Keep a list (chain) at each slot, and just add to or search through the list as necessary. Degrades to <code>O(N)</code> access time if some chains become very long.</li>\n      <li><strong>Open Addressing:</strong> If a slot is occupied, choose the next one in a sequence. For Linear Probing, this means the very next empty slot; for other types of probing (e.g. Quadratic Probing), it means skipping ahead some number of positions to avoid value clustering in some parts of the table. Degrades to <code>O(N)</code> access time if clustering becomes frequent.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>In addition to the above, another method is to modify Separate Chaining to use a Binary Search Tree (BST) instead of a linear list. This approach allows even highly-occupied slots to have <code>O(log n)</code> (instead of linear) access time. However, in order to maintain this faster access time, the BST must be self-balancing.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p>You are provided with an <code>Entry</code> class to instantiate key-value entries for the hash table.

A function is only ever defined <strong>once</strong> for a program.</p>\n      <p>Function definitions are composed of a header and a body. The header includes the name of the function and its parameters, which are the variable names to use for the arguments that will be passed in when the function is called. The body makes up all the lines of code that will run when the function is called; it must be indented and may be composed of one or more lines.</p>\n      <pre>\n      def add_one(x):   # header\n          return x + 1  # body</pre>\n      <p>The body will almost always contain one or more <code>return</code> statements, which determine the value of a function call. A function will immediately stop when it reaches a <code>return</code> statement. (Multiple <code>return</code> statements only make sense in the context of conditional execution, as described in a later assignment.) A Python function call that completes without encountering a <code>return</code> statement will evaluate to <code>None</code> by default.</p>\n\n      <h4>Type Annotations</h4>\n      <p>As of Python 3.5, function headers may also include parameter and return type annotations to make it clear what data types are input and output by the function. If the <code>add_one</code> function was meant to receive an integer argument and return an integer result, its type-annotated header would be the following:</p>\n      <pre>\n      def add_one(x: int) -&gt; int:</pre>\n      <p>Python is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information\">dynamically-typed</a> language, meaning that data types used in the program are not known to be correct until the program is already running (in contrast to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking\">statically-typed</a> language). The benefit of dynamic typing is less code and more flexibility, at the cost of less error checking by a compiler and the potential for more bugs.</p>\n      <p>To aid your learning and help you detect bugs early, all functions headers in this and future assignments must have correct type annotations. With some exceptions, variables will not require type annotations.</p>\n      <p>The following is a list of the type annotations for the types discussed thus far.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><code>bool</code></li>\n        <li><code>int</code></li>\n        <li><code>float</code></li>\n        <li><code>str</code></li>\n        <li><code>None</code></li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Testing</h4>\n      <p>You are required to write tests for every function implemented. Tests must be written using <code>assert</code> statements, which are composed of the reserved word <code>assert</code> followed by some expression. When this expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, the program continues to the next line; otherwise, an <code>AssertionError</code> is raised and the program terminates.</p>\n      <p>In the following example, several lines are executed until one of the expressions following <code>assert</code> evaluates to <code>False</code>, causing an <code>AssertionError</code> that terminates the program. The <code>==</code> operator checks for the equality of its operands.</p>\n      <pre>\n      assert True\n      assert not False\n      assert 1 == 1\n      assert add_one(1) == 2\n      assert add_one(2) == 4  # AssertionError raised\n      assert add_one(3) == 4  # line not reached</pre>\n      <p>In the preceding case, the cause of the test failure was a bad test; in other words, the expected value should have been <code>3</code> instead of <code>4</code>. However, the usual cause of a test failure is a bug in the function definition, which may have remained unknown to the developer without a comprehensive test suite.</p>\n      <p>Tests are typically written in a separate file (known in Python as a module). To access function definitions from another module, they must be imported into the test module. Thus, if the <code>add_one</code> function is defined in a <code>defs.py</code>, it can be imported and used as in the following example.</p>\n      <pre>\n      import defs                  # do not include \".py\" extension of file name\n\n      assert defs.add_one(1) == 2  # each call must be preceded by module name (e.g. \"defs.\")\n      assert defs.add_one(2) == 3\n      assert defs.add_one(3) == 4</pre>\n      <p>A test module can be run just like any other Python module. If the above file was named <code>tests.py</code>, it could be run with the following command:</p>\n      <pre>\n      python3 tests.py</pre>\n      <p>If an <code>AssertionError</code> is displayed, it means one of the tests failed; otherwise, all executed tests passed.</p>\n\n      <p>As a software engineer, it is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that, when possible, you practice test-driven development (TDD). This practice entails writing tests <strong>before</strong> writing the function definitions for those tests. In doing so, you will have a better understanding as to what the functions take as input and produce as output, which makes writing the function definition easier.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <FunctionSignature name=\"print_hello\" :params=\"[['name', 'str']]\"/>\n      <p>Given a string <code>name</code>, display the message <samp>\"Hello \" + name</samp>.

Additional metrics may also be used, such as attributing higher scores to smaller programs to promote brevity; however, while such additions may be used to break ties, accuracy should be the primary basis for evaluation.</p>\n\n      <h6>Selection</h6>\n      <p>Once all of the individuals in a generation have been scored, the next generation can be constructed. To do so, individuals from the current generation must be selected (typically in pairs) for the crossover stage. Prior to selection, the entire generation's fitness scores are usually normalized to probabilities (if lower fitness scores indicate better individuals, simply subtract each score from the sum of all scores). Afterward, individuals may be randomly sampled from the population and their corresponding weights accumulated until this sum exceeds a randomized threshold, at which point that individual is selected.</p>\n      <p>In addition to this approach, it can also be beneficial to only consider for selection individuals that fall within a certain top percentile. However, it is important not to remove too many individuals from consideration or else the population will converge too quickly.</p>\n\n      <h6>Crossover and Mutation</h6>\n      <p>Once two individuals have been selected, the crossover method specifies at which point the individuals will be divided and recombined to create new individuals. Typically, two-point crossover is used in which both individuals are divided at the same point and two successor individuals result from swapping either of the two segments. Other forms of crossover exist, including three-point and uniform crossover, the latter of which swaps individual elements of the sequents instead of segments as a whole.</p>\n      <p>In addition, GAs often provide a chance for the resulting successor individuals to undergo mutation, whereby one or more of their elements are randomly changed. This step can help prevent individuals from converging by promoting diversity; however, if used too frequently, the benefits of crossover are lost and the search becomes a random walk. Mutation may include different probabilities for adding, deleting, or modifying parts of an individual.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p><strong>Allowed Modules:</strong> <code>random</code></p>\n      <p>Your GA implementation should not deviate too far from methods discussed in lecture. You may need to experiment with different parameters to find a balance that works in a timely manner. These parameters include (not exhaustively):</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Size of the starting population</li>\n        <li>Lower and upper bounds on program lengths</li>\n        <li>Percentile kept for the next generation</li>\n        <li>Mutation rates</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>The <code>biogimmickry.py</code> file (linked above) provides a <code>FitnessEvaluator</code> class that performs scoring for a program, with a score of zero indicating that the program, when interpreted, populates a memory array that exactly matches an array that was used to instantiate the <code>FitnessEvaluator</code>. It is this score that must be used for the selection process, as well as determining whether the search is complete.</p>\n      <p>The <code>FitnessEvaluator</code> class should not be modified. It is instantiated once prior to a search and is accessed using <code>FitnessEvaluator.evaluate(program)</code> to receive a score for a <code>program</code> string. For an example of how to instantiate it, see the <code>main</code> function in the file.</p>\n\n      <h4>Required Functions</h4>\n      <p>In the following instructions, \"program\" refers to a BF program, and \"loop\" refers to loops in BF programs (not Python loops). The \"target array\" is what the BF interpreter's memory must match when a solution program is run.</p>\n      <p>Assume all target arrays have an <strong>absolute sum</strong> no greater than <code>20</code> (e.g. <code>(2, -4, 6, -8)</code>).</p>\n\n      <FunctionSignature name=\"create_program\" :params=\"[['fe', 'FitnessEvaluator'], ['max_len', 'int']]\" type=\"str\" />\n      <p>Return a program string no longer than <code>max_len</code> that, when interpreted, populates a memory array that exactly matches a target array.</p>\n\n      <p>The <code>max_len</code> argument forces programs to use loops by limiting their length. If <code>max_len</code> is zero, it may be disregarded; in other words, a loop will not be necessary to match the target array. In this case, you may choose an appropriate upper bound for program lengths, keeping in mind that longer programs take more time to evaluate. However, if <code>max_len</code> is positive, the length of the program returned by this function must not exceed this value. Use this distinction to first ensure your algorithm correctly generates programs without loops before adding the logic to match arrays iteratively.</p>\n      <p>For non-loop programs, the target array will never exceed a length of <code>8</code>; for programs requiring a loop, the target array length will always be <code>2</code>, with one element set to zero (to be used as a loop counter) and the absolute value of the other element greater than <code>max_len</code>. For example, a target array might be <code>(0, 20)</code> with a <code>max_len</code> of <code>18</code>. Thus, because the length of the program must be less than the absolute sum of the array, a proper use of the loop (with a counter) must be found by the genetic algorithm to match the target array.</p>\n      <p>Note that the minimum length of any program containing a loop should be <code>12</code>, as a loop in a shorter program would not be necessary or meaningful. For example, a minimum-length loop-containing program might look like <code>\"+++[&gt;++++&lt;-]\"</code>. Programs without loops may be of any length.</p>\n\n      <p>When implementing this function, you may want to follow these steps:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          Initialize a population of random programs\n          <ul>\n            <li>Population size should be as large as possible (usually over <code>500</code>) without significantly slowing down each generation</li>\n            <li>Programs should never be greater in length than <code>max_len</code> (if non-zero)</li>\n            <li>Do not create programs with more than one loop; that way lies madness</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Score all programs using <code>FitnessEvaluator.evaluate(program)</code>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Stop if a program has a fitness score of zero</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Select two programs in the top <code>N</code> percentile weighted by score using <code><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices\">random.choices</a></code> (or some other weighting method)\n          <ol type=\"a\">\n            <li>\n              Use crossover to create two new programs, ensuring both do not exceed <code>max_len</code> (if non-zero)<br />If a loop exists, avoid breaking it by ensuring the crossover point is:\n              <ul>\n                <li>To the left of both programs' <code>[</code> command</li>\n                <li>To the right of both programs' <code>]</code> command</li>\n                <li>Between both programs' <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> commands</li>\n              </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Randomly mutate zero or more elements in each of the new programs\n              <ul>\n                <li>Mutation may be any of addition, deletion, or editing of commands, each with separate probabilities</li>\n                <li>Ensure that mutation maintains one loop in the program and does not cause it to exceed <code>max_len</code></li>\n              </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>Add the new programs to the next generation</li>\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n        <li>Repeat Step 3 until the next generation is the size of the previous generation</li>\n        <li>Go to Step 2 using the next generation UNLESS it has converged, in which case go to Step 1</li>\n      </ol>\n    </template>\n  </Assignment>\n</template>\n\n\n<script>\nimport Assignment from \"@/components/BaseAssignment.vue\"\nimport FunctionSignature from \"@/components/AssignmentFunctionSignature.vue\"\n\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    Assignment,\n    FunctionSignature\n  },\n  data:\n    function () {\n      return {\n        name: \"biogimmickry\",\n        title: \"Project III: Biogimmickry\",\n        files: [\"biogimmickry.py\"],\n        rubric: {\n          \"Matches 1 Length Array\": 15,\n          \"Matches 2-4 Length Non-Negative Array\": 20,\n          \"Matches 5-8 Length Array\": 30,\n          \"Iteratively Matches 2 Length Array\": 35\n        }\n      };\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n<style scoped>\ntd:first-child {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ProjectBiogimmickry.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";

However, unlike lists (but like strings), tuples are <strong>immutable</strong>, meaning that their contents or size cannot be changed after creation. Using immutable sequence types can result in programs that are less bug-prone since you do not need to be concerned with how the sequence might get changed elsewhere in the program. Tuples also require less memory to manage (for reasons discussed in a systems programming course) and are thus more memory efficient.</p>\n      <p>To create a tuple, use parentheses instead of brackets: <code>ints = (1, 2, 3)</code></p>\n\n      <h4>List Comprehensions</h4>\n      <p>List comprehensions offer a means of creating simple or complex lists with relatively few lines of code. This feature does have some limitations, and may not be used for any list that requires referencing itself (such as removing duplicates).</p>\n\n      <p>List comprehensions often have the structure shown below (colored words represent placeholders).</p>\n      <pre>values = [<span style=\"color: red;\">value</span> for <span style=\"color: green;\">variable</span> in <span style=\"color: blue;\">sequence</span> if <span style=\"color: orange;\">condition</span>]</pre>\n      <p>The <span style=\"color: green;\">variable</span> and <span style=\"color: blue;\">sequence</span> values function just like those in a <code>for</code> statement. On each iteration of the <code>for</code> loop, <span style=\"color: red;\">value</span> is added to the new list being created unless <span style=\"color: orange;\">condition</span> is <code>False</code> on that iteration. The <span style=\"color: red;\">value</span> may be any expression, including literals, arithmetic expressions, function calls, if-expressions, or even other list comprehensions. The <span style=\"color: orange;\">condition</span> is optional, and may be omitted when <span style=\"color: red;\">value</span> is to be added on every iteration.</p>\n\n      <p>Without using a list comprehension, the example above would look like the following:</p>\n      <pre>\nvalues = []\nfor <span style=\"color: green;\">variable</span> in <span style=\"color: blue;\">sequence</span>:\n    if <span style=\"color: orange;\">condition</span>:\n        values.append(<span style=\"color: red;\">value</span>)</pre>\n\n      <h4>Sequence Type Annotations</h4>\n      <p>Using Python's type annotation syntax, lists can be specified as <code>List[Type]</code>, where <code>Type</code> refers to a data type, such as <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>. Multidimensional sequences require nesting these annotations; for example, a 2D list of integers would be <code>List[List[int]]</code>.</p>\n\n      <p>To gain access to the above annotations in your program, include the following line before your function definitions:</p>\n      <pre>from typing import List, Tuple</pre>\n      <p>Note that <code>typing</code> is the only module for which you may use the <code>from</code> import notation in this course.</p>\n\n      <h4>Polynomial Arithmetic</h4>\n      <p>You will implement two functions that perform basic arithmetic on polynomials, such that each polynomial will be represented as a list. The values in the list will represent the coefficients of the terms whereas the indices will represent the exponents for the terms.</p>\n      <p>Thus, the polynomial 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5 will be represented by the following list:</p>\n      <pre>\n      poly = []\n      poly.append(5)\n      poly.append(3)\n      poly.append(2)</pre>\n      <p>This list can also be created directly as follows:</p>\n      <pre>\n      poly = [5, 3, 2]</pre>\n      <p>Notice that the term with exponent 0 is first in the list while the term with exponent 2 is last; thus, the terms in the list are in reverse order of how they are typically written in mathematics so that an element's index represents that term's exponent. You may think this mapping of a polynomial to a list is a bit odd. In fact, attributing meaning to indices of a list (and not just the values within the list) is an important skill that allows a list to be used as more than just a substitution for a bunch of variables.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p>For problems that require iteration, you may use either a <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop. Note that most of these problems cannot be solved with list comprehensions.</p>\n\n      <FunctionSignature name=\"poly_add\" :params=\"[['poly1', 'List[int]'], ['poly2', 'List[int]']]\" type=\"List[int]\"/>\n      <p>Return a list representing the sum of the given polynomials, which have the same degree (list length).

For example, if a function sometimes returns a string and sometimes returns <code>None</code>, use <code>Optional[str]</code> for the return type.</p>\n      <p>To gain access to the <code>Optional</code> annotation in your program, include the following line before your function definitions:</p>\n      <pre>from typing import Optional</pre>\n      <p>Note that <code>typing</code> is the only module for which you may use the <code>from</code> import notation in this course (unless otherwise stated).</p>\n\n      <h4>Testing</h4>\n      <p>In this and future assignments, all functions must have at least 5 test cases in the required tests file.

These networks are <em>very loosely</em> based on how the human brain functions, and their recent success is largely tied to how well they can scale and be adapted to suit a problem (in addition to the accessibility of very large data sets and massively parallel computing via GPUs). Put another way, neural networks represent one of the most versatile means to approximate a function.</p>\n\n      <h4>Layered Model</h4>\n      <p>The architecture of a neural network is composed of a sequence of <em>layers</em>, with each layer composed of a number of <em>neurons</em> (also known as units). Neurons each contain exactly one bias value, which is used in generating a value to send to the next layer. The neurons in one layer are connected to the neurons in another layer by weights, which may be thought of as edges between two vertices. In a <em>Feedforward Network</em>, these edges are directed toward the output layer only; because neurons within the same layer are not connected, these networks represent directed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipartite_graph\">Multipartite Graphs</a>.</p>\n      <img src=\"https://1.cms.s81c.com/sites/default/files/2021-01-06/ICLH_Diagram_Batch_01_03-DeepNeuralNetwork-WHITEBG.png\"\n         style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 30%;\"/>\n      <figcaption style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks</figcaption>\n\n      <br/>\n      <p>The minimum number of layers in a network is two: an input layer and an output layer. However, these simple networks rarely generalize to meaningful mappings, and therefore additional layers are added in between to increase the sophistication of the network. Because the inputs and outputs of these layers are not directly observed, they are known as <em>hidden layers</em>, and any network that uses one or more hidden layers is said to be a deep neural network (and hence engages in \"deep learning\").</p>\n\n      <h4>Network Training</h4>\n      <p>The goal of training a neural network is to find suitable values for the weights and biases (mentioned above). An optimal assignment of these values would allow any never-before-seen input to map to its expected output, providing a highly accurate approximation of the target function.</p>\n      <p>At the start of the training process, the weights are often initialized to small random values; because the biases are added to the output instead of multiplied, they may be initialized to zero. On each iteration of a forward propagation, a training sample is sent through the network, layer by layer, up until and including the output layer. The output is then compared to the expected output (which is known during supervised training), and the <em>loss</em> is computed using a loss function (e.g. squared error).</p>\n      <p>At each layer, the output of each neuron to be sent to the next layer is computed as</p>\n      <pre>a = &sigma;(wx+b)</pre>\n      <p>where the input vector <code>x</code> is multiplied by the neuron's incoming weights <code>w</code> and then added to the bias <code>b</code>. The result is then passed to the activation function <code>&sigma;</code>, which is typically the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)\">ReLU</a> function for hidden layers and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function\">sigmoid</a> function for the output layer.</p>\n      <p>On each iteration of training, forward propagation processes multiple training samples - but usually not <em>all</em> training samples, as that would take too long with the typically large training sets used. Instead, small random subsets of the training set called mini-batches are used for that iteration; on the next iteration, a new random mini-batch is created. The use of mini-batching allows for many iterations of the training process while still making it likely that every training sample is used at least once.</p>\n      <p>Once all mini-batch training samples have been forward propagated, the losses are aggregated (usually averaged) to a <em>cost</em>, which serves as a measure of how well the network did during that iteration of training. The cost is then used to determine how to update the output layer's weights and biases. These updates are in turn used to update the previous layer's weights and biases, which continues up until but not including the input layer (which has no weights or biases). This process is known as backpropagation, and is central to training the network.</p>\n\n      <h4>Backpropagation</h4>\n      <p>Once the cost is known, the next step is to determine by how much the weights and biases need to be adjusted in order for the cost to be reduced on subsequent iterations. Doing so requires knowing the <em>gradient</em> (essentially a slope in multidimensional space) of certain values, which will point to their direction of steepest descent with respect to the cost and thus provide faster learning. This technique is known as gradient descent - or stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when mini-batching is used.</p>\n      <p>Consider that the output of a network during forward propagation may be thought of as a composite of activation functions (where <code>x</code> is the input vector, <code>y</code> is the output vector, <code>W</code> is a weight matrix and <code>b</code> is a bias vector).</p>\n      <pre>y = &sigma;<sub>2</sub>(W<sub>2</sub>&sigma;<sub>1</sub>(W<sub>1</sub>&sigma;<sub>0</sub>(W<sub>0</sub>x+b<sub>0</sub>)+b<sub>1</sub>)+b<sub>2</sub>)</pre>\n      <p>Thus, to get the gradients, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule\">Chain Rule</a> from calculus may be used. Gradients are computed starting at the final (output layer) and working toward the input layer, with <code>da</code> initialized to the derivative of the loss function. Although the following formulas should be used, understanding why they work is not necessary to complete this assignment.</p>\n      <pre>\ndz<sub>n</sub> = da<sub>n</sub> &#8857; g'<sub>n</sub>(z<sub>n</sub>)\ndW<sub>n</sub> = dz<sub>n</sub> &sdot; a<sup>T</sup><sub>n-1</sub>\ndb<sub>n</sub> = dz<sub>n</sub>\nda<sub>n-1</sub> = W<sup>T</sup><sub>n</sub> &sdot; dz<sub>n</sub></pre>\n      <p>In the above, <code>n</code> denotes a value at the current layer and <code>n - 1</code> the layer that comes before it. The &sdot; operator refers to matrix multiplication whereas the &#8857; operator refers to elementwise multiplication (or Hadamard product). Variables prefixed with a <code>d</code> refer to the gradient (derivative) of those values (e.g. <code>dz<sub>n</sub></code> refers to the gradient vector of <code>z<sub>n</sub></code>).</p>\n\n      <h4>Updating Parameters</h4>\n      <p>Once backpropagation has been performed on every sample that was forward propagated in a mini-batch, the weights and biases may be updated. Recall that it is these updates that ultimately train the network. Fortunately, unlike backpropagation, updating the network's parameters is more straightforward. In this step, a <em>learning rate</em> is used, which typically starts high at the beginning of the training process and decreases over time to keep the network from diverging. For each layer, update each weight and bias value by subtracting it from the negated product of the gradient and the learning rate.</p>\n      <pre>w<sub>p</sub><sub>q</sub> = w<sub>p</sub><sub>q</sub> - &alpha;&#9661;</pre>\n      <p>In the above, let <code>&alpha;</code> be the learning rate, <code>&#9661;</code> be the gradient, and <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> be the position of a single weight in the weight matrix to be updated. Each bias vector would be updated in a similar way.</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:implementation>\n      <p><strong>Allowed Modules:</strong> math, itertools, random</p>\n\n      <p style=\"color: red;\">You may optionally work in pairs for this assignment. However, the collaboration policy still applies; do not share code outside your pair. You may quit a pair after working together if you like, but you should then complete the assignment individually (i.e. do not join a new pair). Include both names of your pair at the top of your submission - even if you stopped working together - so that your submissions do not get flagged for collaboration.</p>\n\n      <p>The following free resources may help you in completing this assignment:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Text: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/\">neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com</a></li>\n        <li>Videos: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaWThlrpebULGM5bbaCX6M7bRuzcM8rd\">www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaWThlrpebULGM5bbaCX6M7bRuzcM8rd</a> (suggested list - not all videos required)</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>In this assignment, you will train a network to learn how to perform simple arithmetic operations. For example, given the operation <code>x + y</code>, the network must be able to accept two operands as input and output their sum. However, to help the network form more complex associations with these operands, they will be represented in 8-bit binary - specifically, as a tuple of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s; for inputs of multiple operands, the tuples will be concatenated into a single tuple. You may assume inputs and outputs will always be non-negative integers (i.e. standard division will not be used) and that all outputs will be small enough to represent with 8 bits.</p>\n\n      <p>To illustrate, suppose the operation to be learned is multiplication (<code>x * y</code>) and we have the following sample:</p>\n      <pre>\nOperand<sub>1</sub>: 2 -&gt; 00000010\nOperand<sub>2</sub>: 3 -&gt; 00000011\n <sub> </sub>Result: 6 -&gt; 00000110</pre>\n      <p>In this example, the inputs and the expected outputs would look like:</p>\n      <pre>\nINPUT\nLAYER\n------\n0 -&gt; |          |\n0 -&gt; |          |\n0 -&gt; |          |\n0 -&gt; |          |\n0 -&gt; |          |        | -&gt; 0\n0 -&gt; |          |        | -&gt; 0\n1 -&gt; |          |        | -&gt; 0\n0 -&gt; |  HIDDEN  | OUTPUT | -&gt; 0\n0 -&gt; | LAYER(S) | LAYER  | -&gt; 0\n0 -&gt; |          |        | -&gt; 1\n0 -&gt; |          |        | -&gt; 1\n0 -&gt; |          |        | -&gt; 0\n0 -&gt; |          |\n0 -&gt; |          |\n1 -&gt; |          |\n1 -&gt; |          |\n</pre>\n      <p>In practice, the network will not be so accurate as to get exactly a <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> from its output layer (which uses the sigmoid activation function). Rather, these values will be somewhere between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code>; the farther an output is from <code>0.5</code> in either direction, the more confident the network is in that decision. Regardless of its confidence, each output value will be rounded to whichever integer is closer during network evaluation (e.g. a <code>0.49</code> will be rounded to <code>0</code>).</p>\n\n\n\n      <p>See the starter file for the following provided components.</p>\n      <div style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">\n      <h6>Classes</h6>\n      <ul>\n        <li><code>Math</code> provides a collection of static methods for mathematical operations</li>\n        <li><code>Layer</code> serves as the foundation for the network's representation</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h6>Functions</h6>\n      <ul>\n        <li><code>create_samples</code> generates a mapping of input-output pairs to be used in training and testing</li>\n        <li><code>main</code> contains a simple test driver</li>\n      </ul>\n      </div>\n\n      <FunctionSignature name=\"train_network\" :params=\"[['samples', 'Dict[Tuple[int, ...], Tuple[int, ...]]'], ['i_size', 'int'], ['o_size', 'int']]\" type=\"List[Layer]\"/>\n      <p>Given a training set (with labels) and the sizes of the input and output layers, create and train a network by iteratively propagating inputs (forward) and their losses (backward) to update its weights and biases.

Your instructor's job is to present the material in a clear, structured, and hopefully interesting manner; it is your job to get started on assignments early, study regularly, and ask questions when something is not understood. When you request assistance, your instructor will not provide you solutions but rather give you guidance on what to consider or how next to proceed.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Course Topics</h2>\n    <p>Throughout the term, you will be introduced, among others, to the following topics.</p>\n\n    <ul v-if=\"course === 101\">\n      <li>Atomic Data Types: Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings</li>\n      <li>Variables and Scope</li>\n      <li>Function Calls and Definitions</li>\n      <li>Arithmetic, Relational, and Boolean Expressions</li>\n      <li>Conditional Branching: If Statements</li>\n      <li>Conditional and Sequential Iteration: While and For Loops</li>\n      <li>Sequential Compound Data Types: Lists and Tuples</li>\n      <li>Error Handling</li>\n      <li>Object-Oriented Basics</li>\n      <li>Simple Sorting and Searching Algorithms</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <ul v-if=\"course === 202\">\n      <li>Linked Lists</li>\n      <li>Stacks &amp; Queues</li>\n      <li>Recursion &amp; Recursive Sorting</li>\n      <li>Unit Testing</li>\n      <li>Binary Search Trees</li>\n      <li>Heaps</li>\n      <li>Hash Tables</li>\n      <li>Algorithm Analysis &amp; Big-O Notation</li>\n      <li>Basic Graph Theory</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <ul v-if=\"course === 480\">\n      <li>The Agent Model</li>\n      <li>Informed Search Methods</li>\n      <li>Local Search Methods</li>\n      <li>Genetic Algorithms</li>\n      <li>Constraint Propagation</li>\n      <li>Monte Carlo Tree Search</li>\n      <li>Overview of Supervised/Unsupervised Learning</li>\n      <li>Applied Reinforcement Learning</li>\n      <li>Feedforward Neural Networks</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    course: Number\n  }\n}\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./CourseDescription.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./CourseDescription.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./CourseDescription.vue?vue&type=template&id=05b639e2&\"\nimport script from \"./CourseDescription.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./CourseDescription.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('Assignment',{attrs:{\"name\":_vm.name,\"title\":_vm.title,\"files\":_vm.files},scopedSlots:_vm._u([{key:\"description\",fn:function(){return [_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Standard queues are a simple First In First Out (FIFO) abstract data type that support the enqueueing of items and dequeueing them in the order they entered.

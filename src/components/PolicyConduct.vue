    <h1>Student Conduct</h1>
    <hr/>

    <h2>Collaboration </h2>
    <p>This course has a very strict policy regarding collaborating with other students. Violating these rules may result in being failed from the course along with notification to the Office of Student Rights &amp; Responsibilities.</p>

    <h4>Projects</h4>
    <p>Project code may not be shared or discussed between students. Submissions flagged for structurally similar code will receive no credit on the first offense; a second offense will result in course failure. Especially egregious examples of collaboration may warrant failure on the first offense.</p>
    <p>In addition, the work you submit must be entirely your original creation. Using solutions from any other source is forbidden. In particular, using solutions from previous offerings is not allowed. Using solutions found on the Internet or getting help from online forums is also not allowed.</p>
    <p>Students have been flagged for collaboration while claiming that their work had been plagiarized (copied without their consent). However, you are responsible for protecting your work, which includes logging out from public workstations when you are finished, retaining private permissions on your files, and not letting other students use your personal computer where you store your coursework (which would also be bad social distancing); if you must leave your machine unattended for any length of time, ensure that it is password-protected.</p>

    <h4>Repositories</h4>
    <p>If you use repositories to archive your work (such as those provided by GitHub), do not make them publicly accessible, <strong>even after the course ends</strong>. This rule includes work that permits collaboration (problem sets), as the purpose of allowing collaboration is for students to arrive at solutions together rather than copy one another's work.</p>
    <p>If you wish to share your work with a potential employer, you must do so in a way that does not make your coursework accessible to everyone else. Violating this rule will be considered the same as sharing your code directly with another student, and may be grounds for course failure; if your course grade has already been assigned, it may be changed retroactively.</p>
    <p>This rule also applies to any other means of sharing work, including posting on forums or messaging services.</p>

    <h4>Quizzes</h4>
    <p>You are not permitted to receive personal assistance on the quiz in any form, including but not limited to tutoring or posting questions to forums. You may not work with other students on quizzes, nor may you discuss their content with students who have yet to take them.</p>

<!--
    <h4>Final Exam</h4>
    <p>You are not permitted to reference any information while taking the exam, including your notes or code you've written previously. You may not work with other students on the exam, nor may you discuss its contents with students who have yet to take it.</p>

    <h4>Quizzes &amp; Exams</h4>
    <p>You may not work with other students on quizzes or exams, nor may you discuss their content with students who have yet to take them.</p>
    <p>All quizzes and exams are closed-notes; students found to be using notes or devices will be failed immediately.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h2>Participation</h2>
    <p>A small part of your grade will be determined by your attendance rate and contribution to class discussions. While you should try not to dominate any conversation, you should participate frequently enough so that I know who you are by the end of the term.</p>

    <h2>Etiquette</h2>
    <p>Disruptive behavior may negatively affect your participation grade. If you are suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you may be asked to leave. Smoking or vaping is not permitted on campus. <strong>Students found to be smoking or vaping in class will be immediately failed from the course on the first offense.</strong></p>

    <h2>Electronic Devices</h2>
    <p>The use of electronic devices is prohibited during the lecture hour, even (and especially) during individual and group tasks. These devices include phones, laptops and tablets, with the exception of writing tablets that are placed flat on your desk. If you have a good educational or medical reason for needing to use an electronic device during lecture, please speak with me.</p>

    <h2>PolyLearn Photo</h2>
    <p>To help me learn names, submit a recent, clearly identifiable (and properly oriented) portrait photo to PolyLearn. You may update your photo on PolyLearn by selecting <code>Profile</code> under your name in the upper-right corner and then clicking <code>Edit profile</code> under "User details".</p>

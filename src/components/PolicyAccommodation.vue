    <hr/>
    <h2>Illness &amp; Injury</h2>
    <p>Students who become seriously ill or require prolonged absence due to injury should contact the instructor as soon as they are able to do so. Additional time on assignments and make-up quizzes may be granted if documentation from a medical provider or other relevant source is provided. Notes from the Health Center simply acknowledging that you were seen by a health care professional are generally not sufficient.</p>
    <p>If you test positive for COVID-19, please contact the instructor as soon as you are able (a relative or friend may do so on your behalf if you are too ill). Written verification from your medical provider may still be required (at a later date) to determine a suitable accommodation (which could be a grade of Incomplete, if appropriate).</p>
    <h2>Disability Resource Center</h2>
    <p>It is university policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and the Disability Resource Center, Building 124, Room 119, at (805) 756-1395, as early as possible in the term.</p>
    <p>Students with an extended test time accommodation are encouraged to take exams with the class to ensure that questions can be answered by the instructor. These students may use headphones during exams to help minimize distractions.</p>
    <p>Students with an assignment extension accommodation must request any extension with the instructor at least 24 hours prior to the deadline. Only one extension per assignment may be granted. It is highly recommended that these extensions be requested conservatively to avoid falling behind in course work.</p>

An active deployment of this site can be accessed here: https://daniel-kauffman.github.io/calpoly-vue/

This repo contains the Vue site used for my primary courses:

* CPE 101: Fundamentals of Computer Science

Note that some file links may be broken (particularly for CPE 101). If you are a former student trying to access previous assignments, please email dkauffma@calpoly.edu with any accessibility issues.
